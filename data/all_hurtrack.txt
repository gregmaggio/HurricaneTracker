  Description:
    Abstract:
      This Historical North Atlantic and Eastern North Pacific Tropical
      Cyclone Tracks file contains the 6-hourly (0000, 0600, 1200, 1800 UTC)
      center locations and intensities for all subtropical depressions and
      storms, extratropical storms, tropical lows, waves, disturbances,
      depressions and storms, and all hurricanes, from 1851 through 2009.
    Purpose:
      These data are intended for geographic display and analysis at the
      national level, and for large regional areas.  The data should be
      displayed and analyzed at scales appropriate for 1:2,000,000-scale data.
      No responsibility is assumed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
      Administration in the use of these data.

      of the Eastern North Pacific Basin, 1949-2006, NCDC/NHC Historical Climatology 
      Series 6-3, pp.9-10, as well as in NOAA Technical Memorandum NWS NHC 25: A 
      Tropical Cyclone Data Tape for the Eastern and Central North Pacific Basins, 
      1949-1983: Contents, Limitations, and Uses - Mary A. S. Davis, Gail M. Brown, 
      and Preston Leftwich - September, 1984. Similar standards and techniques were 
      applied to the post-1999 (Atlantic) and post-1983 (Pacific) data. 
  Logical_Consistency_Report:
    Over-water portions of storm tracks before 1944 are subject to considerable
    uncertainties.  Aircraft reconnaissance of storms near critical areas was
    introduced in 1944, and continuous weather satellite surveillance was
    introduced in the mid-1960s.  These two developments mean that more recent
    storm records have a higher degree of accuracy than those prior to 1944.
    No tests for logical consistency have been performed on this data set.
  Completeness_Report:
    This data set includes all known Atlantic Basin (Gulf of Mexico, Caribbean
    Sea, and North Atlantic Ocean) and Eastern North Pacific tropical
    cyclones between 1851 and 2009 (Atlantic) and 1949 and 2009 (Pacific).
    The term tropical cyclone as used here refers to subtropical depressions
    and storms, tropical depressions and storms, and all categories of
    hurricanes from Category 1 to Category 5.  This dataset also includes
    hybrid systems such as tropical lows, waves, subtropical depressions and 
    storms, as well as extratropical storms.

      Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy_Report:
        Over-water portions of storm tracks before 1944 are subject to
        considerable uncertainties.  Aircraft reconnaissance of storms near
        critical areas was introduced in 1944, and continuous weather satellite
        surveillance was introduced in the mid-1960s.  These two developments
        allow a high degree of probability that more recent storm center
        locations were determined with a reasonable degree of accuracy.

    Process_Step:
      Process_Description:
        Historical track information was downloaded from the National Hurricane
        Center's Web site.  The textual information was formatted using a PERL
        script written by the NOAA Coastal Services Center.  The file was then
        brought into ArcGIS as a table and converted to a shapefile with
        attributes using a custom Visual Basic extension.

  Detailed_Description:
    Entity_Type:
      Entity_Type_Label: Subtropical and tropical cyclone tracks
      Entity_Type_Definition:
        The path followed by the center of a subtropical or tropical cyclone or
        related storm.  A subtropical cyclone is a low pressure system that
        develops over subtropical waters and that initially has a non-tropical
        circulation but in which some elements of tropical cyclone cloud
        structure are present.  Subtropical cyclones can evolve into tropical
        cyclones.  A tropical cyclone is a warm-core, non-frontal low-pressure
        system that develops over tropical or subtropical waters, covering a
        large region and with organized convection (i.e. thunderstorm activity)
        and definite cyclonic (counter-clockwise circular) surface wind
        circulation.  Related storms are those that develop into subtropical or
        tropical cyclones or develop from them, such as tropical disturbances,
        lows, waves, and extratropical storms.

            The storm was classified as a tropical disturbance at the time of
            the advisory.  A tropical disturbance is a discrete tropical weather
            system of apparently organized convection (i.e. thunderstorm
            activity), which is generally 100 to 300 nautical miles in diameter.
            It originates in the tropics or subtropics, has a nonfrontal
            migratory character, and maintains its identity for 24 hours or
            more.  It does not necessarily exhibit circulation, but may develop
            into a tropical cyclone.

          Enumerated_Domain_Value_Definition:
            The storm was classified as Extratropical at the time of the
            advisory.  Extratropical is a term used in advisories and tropical
            summaries to indicate that a cyclone has lost its tropical
            characteristics.  The term implies both that the cyclone has moved
            out of the tropics and that the energy source driving the storm has
            changed.  While tropical cyclones derive their energy from the
            convection of warm, moist air, extratropical storms derive their
            energy from the temperature contrast between warm and cold air
            masses.  It is important to note that cyclones can become
            extratropical and still retain winds of hurricane or tropical storm
            force.

            The storm was classified as a tropical wave at the time of the
            advisory.  Tropical waves occur in the trade-wind easterlies, moving
            to the west with a wave-like motion.  They show a detectable shift
            in wind direction, which  may not be detectable at the surface but
            may be seen in the middle atmosphere.  A tropical wave may develop
            into a tropical cyclone.
