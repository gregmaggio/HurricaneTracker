Over-water portions of storm tracks before 1944 are subject to considerable
uncertainties.  Aircraft reconnaissance of storms near critical areas was
introduced in 1944, and continuous weather satellite surveillance was
introduced in the mid-1960s.  These two developments mean that more recent
storm records have a higher degree of accuracy than those prior to 1944.
No tests for logical consistency have been performed on this data set.

This data set includes all known Atlantic Basin (Gulf of Mexico, Caribbean
Sea, and North Atlantic Ocean) tropical cyclones between 1851 and 2008.  The
term tropical cyclone as used here refers to subtropical depressions and
storms, tropical depressions and storms, and all categories of hurricanes
from Category 1 to Category 5.  This dataset also includes hybrid systems
such as tropical lows, waves, subtropical depressions and storms, as well
as extratropical storms.

				<enttypl>Subtropical and tropical cyclone tracks</enttypl>
				<enttypd>
The path followed by the center of a subtropical or tropical cyclone or
related storm.  A subtropical cyclone is a low pressure system that
develops over subtropical waters and that initially has a non-tropical
circulation but in which some elements of tropical cyclone cloud
structure are present.  Subtropical cyclones can evolve into tropical
cyclones.  A tropical cyclone is a warm-core, non-frontal low-pressure
system that develops over tropical or subtropical waters, covering a
large region and with organized convection (i.e. thunderstorm activity)
and definite cyclonic (counter-clockwise circular) surface wind
circulation.  Related storms are those that develop into subtropical or
tropical cyclones or develop from them, such as tropical disturbances,
lows, waves, and extratropical storms.

The storm was classified as a tropical disturbance at the time of
the advisory.  A tropical disturbance is a discrete tropical weather
system of apparently organized convection (i.e. thunderstorm
activity), which is generally 100 to 300 nautical miles in diameter.
It originates in the tropics or subtropics, has a nonfrontal
migratory character, and maintains its identity for 24 hours or
more.  It does not necessarily exhibit circulation, but may develop
into a tropical cyclone.

						<edomv>E</edomv>
						<edomvd>
The storm was classified as Extratropical at the time of the
advisory.  Extratropical is a term used in advisories and tropical
summaries to indicate that a cyclone has lost its tropical
characteristics.  The term implies both that the cyclone has moved
out of the tropics and that the energy source driving the storm has
changed.  While tropical cyclones derive their energy from the
convection of warm, moist air, extratropical storms derive their
energy from the temperature contrast between warm and cold air
masses.  It is important to note that cyclones can become
extratropical and still retain winds of hurricane or tropical storm
force.

The storm was classified as a tropical wave at the time of the
advisory.  Tropical waves occur in the trade-wind easterlies, moving
to the west with a wave-like motion.  They show a detectable shift
in wind direction, which  may not be detectable at the surface but
may be seen in the middle atmosphere.  A tropical wave may develop
into a tropical cyclone.
